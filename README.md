# twitter-bot
This Twitter Bot is based on the Tweepy library. It's basic functionality includes the following:
- Search twitter feed for top tweets and retweet one that is randomly selected from among the top tweets.
- Analyze sentiment using a pre-developed bayesian model for pos/neg sentiment
- Retweet with Intro and emojis, based on the identified sentiment. Uses the tweet-quote approach
- Time functions to enable: sleep from a 'bedtime' to 'waketime' and randomization of time interval by a selected percentage (so that the tweets don't litterally go out like clockwork)
- Randomization of sources to include tweet of quotes with a specified percentage of tweets.
